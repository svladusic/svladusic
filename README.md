### Hi, I'm Stefan!

#### About This Profile
In the coming weeks and months, I will update my profile with some of the solo and collaborative projects I've worked on over the years. The projects range in scope from computer vision for COVID detection in lung images, Credit Risk models for financial portfolios, and better interpreting global climate data using dimensionality reduction.
