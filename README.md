### Hi, I'm Stefan!

#### About This Profile
In the coming weeks and months, I will update my profile with some of the solo and collaborative projects I've worked on over the years. The projects range in scope from computer vision for COVID detection in lung images, Credit Risk models for financial portfolios, and better interpreting global climate data using dimensionality reduction. The commonality between most of these projects is the use of myriad Machine Learning techniques. I am also hoping to upload a repository of the code and data sets used in my [Master's research project](https://uwaterloo.ca/computational-mathematics/sites/ca.computational-mathematics/files/uploads/files/stefan_vladusic_-_major_research_project_updated.pdf), which focused on predicting sudden changes in simplified models of the Atlantic Ocean using a combination of CNN-LSTM neural networks, and some clever applications of dynamical systems theory that built off the work of my former lab mates. Finally, I have a lot of projects I've started just for fun, mostly based around music and visual arts. I will likely make repos for these projects, but there's no set timeline for project completion.
